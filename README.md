# Politico Prototype

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This application is a **prototype for illustration purposes only**. It is designed to demonstrate UI/UX concepts and interactive features for a potential political information platform.

The design is not meant to be "perfect" and responsive and all that jazz. It is just a prototype, trying to demostrate the core concept. This is the first Chrome Extension I ever made, so the code quality is not great, but it works, so it's good enough.

The application is not very responsive. View on desktop for the best results. Also, use dark mode if you value your retinas, but also because the design has been made in dark mode and will most likely look horrible in light mode.

## Usage Guide

1. Clone this repository (see [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md))
2. Open Google Chrome
3. Go to Extensions -> Manage Extensions
4. Select "Load Unpacked" and select the repository folder
5. Turn on the extension (if not already on)
6. Go to ground.news, you should see "Politics" next to "Blindspot" in the navbar.
7. Feel free to explore from there.

**Important notices:**
- All data, statistics, and political information presented are fictional and created for demonstration purposes
- The political positions, events, and figures mentioned do not represent actual political stances or real-world events
- The AI assistant feature ("Frank") is a mock implementation and does not provide actual AI-generated responses
- This prototype is not affiliated with any political party, organization, or government entity
